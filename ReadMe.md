Lab Assignment
REQUIRED (Database)

Create a database user named chirprapp
Grant all privileges to your chirpr database
Hint: use chirpr.* in the ON part of the grant
Create a table named mentions with the following fields/columns:
userid
chirpid
Create a stored procedure named spUserMentions that returns all chirps a user is mentioned in
Parameters: userid
The result set should contain: chirpid, chip text, chirp date
Tip: be sure to insert some fake mentions so that you can test the procedure!
REQUIRED (Node)

In your chirpr API, use your database to store chirps instead of a file
Install and save the mysql NodeJS package using NPM
Configure your connection using createConnection
In each API method, make the appropriate database call to create, read, update, and delete chirps
Create a new API that inserts mentions
Create a new API method that retrieves chirps that a user is mentioned in
Call the spUserMentions stored procedure that you created earlier
ADVANCED

When a chirp is created, check to see if are mentions in the chirp text and add it to the database
Mentions should be put in chirps with the format @username.
Example Chirp: hi @matt it was good to see you in class!
If it does, add a mention to the database as well as the chirp
HINT: You'll have to parse the string and lookup the user by name (use like!)
If you don't have a username on your table, you can use userid (i.e. @1 instead of @matt)
Add the ability in your app to click a username and view all of the chirps that user is mentioned in
Important: There is some creativity that will be needed on your part to put a good interface together that works for this!
